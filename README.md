# MusicGen

The attention layer implemented in MUSICGEN represents a significant advancement in single-stage controllable music generation. Although the results did not surpass the existing metrics we are working on researching more to improve the model for generating high-quality music for its reduced autoregressive time steps compared to conventional methods, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of the attention mechanism. However, certain limitations remain, such as the need for more precise control over adherence to conditioning and the potential for further exploration of data augmentation strategies. It's important to note that all training data used in this study is ethically sourced from the Musiccaps Kaggle dataset, and the model is trained comprehensively on the entire dataset, ensuring robustness and generalization in its musical generation capabilities.
